# Assets Folder

## Excel File Setup

Place your Excel file here with the name: `grocery-data.xlsx`

### How to get the file:

1. **Download from Google Sheets:**
   - Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_k8a4r6HNg96bT49IHOPmHDWRJPcKp_WdpNKeJ6pVEA/edit
   - Click File → Download → Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)
   - Rename the file to `grocery-data.xlsx`
   - Place it in this `src/assets/` folder

2. **Or use your own Excel file:**
   - Name it `grocery-data.xlsx`
   - Place it in this folder
   - The app will automatically read it on startup

The app will try to load from the local file first. If the file is not found, it will attempt to load from Google Sheets as a fallback.
